# static-binaries

some static binaries for linux, maybe useful for bootstrapping, no big deal

# details

- built with/via [crosware](https://github.com/ryanwoodsmall/crosware)
- binaries are built with [musl-cross-make](https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make) compilers
- static compilers are available at [musl-misc](https://github.com/ryanwoodsmall/musl-misc)
- sabotage's [netbsd-curses](https://github.com/sabotage-linux/netbsd-curses) is used to avoid external termcap/terminfo db
- can be run with proper `qemu-${ARCH}-static` setup directly on a system or in a docker container

# note!

:warning: _big stinking warning_ :warning:

- **binaries almost certainly will not be the latest version!**
- **some architectures may or may not be in sync, have all binaries available, etc.!**

these may be useful but they're a means to an end, so don't replace your userspace with these...

updates will be provided, possibly, sometime, on an "i guess i should maybe update that" basis.

# todo

- need to checksum/catalog binaries, sha-256 should work
- capture versions as well?
